    Microsoft ResX Schema 
    
    Version 2.0
    
    The primary goals of this format is to allow a simple XML format 
    that is mostly human readable. The generation and parsing of the 
    various data types are done through the TypeConverter classes 
    associated with the data types.
    
    Example:
    
    ... ado.net/XML headers & schema ...
    <resheader name="resmimetype">text/microsoft-resx</resheader>
    <resheader name="version">2.0</resheader>
    <resheader name="reader">System.Resources.ResXResourceReader, System.Windows.Forms, ...</resheader>
    <resheader name="writer">System.Resources.ResXResourceWriter, System.Windows.Forms, ...</resheader>
    <data name="Name1"><value>this is my long string</value><comment>this is a comment</comment></data>
    <data name="Color1" type="System.Drawing.Color, System.Drawing">Blue</data>
    <data name="Bitmap1" mimetype="application/x-microsoft.net.object.binary.base64">
        <value>[base64 mime encoded serialized .NET Framework object]</value>
    </data>
    <data name="Icon1" type="System.Drawing.Icon, System.Drawing" mimetype="application/x-microsoft.net.object.bytearray.base64">
        <value>[base64 mime encoded string representing a byte array form of the .NET Framework object]</value>
        <comment>This is a comment</comment>
    </data>
                
    There are any number of "resheader" rows that contain simple 
    name/value pairs.
    
    Each data row contains a name, and value. The row also contains a 
    type or mimetype. Type corresponds to a .NET class that support 
    text/value conversion through the TypeConverter architecture. 
    Classes that don't support this are serialized and stored with the 
    mimetype set.
    
    The mimetype is used for serialized objects, and tells the 
    ResXResourceReader how to depersist the object. This is currently not 
    extensible. For a given mimetype the value must be set accordingly:
    
    Note - application/x-microsoft.net.object.binary.base64 is the format 
    that the ResXResourceWriter will generate, however the reader can 
    read any of the formats listed below.
    
    mimetype: application/x-microsoft.net.object.binary.base64
    value   : The object must be serialized with 
            : System.Runtime.Serialization.Formatters.Binary.BinaryFormatter
            : and then encoded with base64 encoding.
    
    mimetype: application/x-microsoft.net.object.soap.base64
    value   : The object must be serialized with 
            : System.Runtime.Serialization.Formatters.Soap.SoapFormatter
            : and then encoded with base64 encoding.

    mimetype: application/x-microsoft.net.object.bytearray.base64
    value   : The object must be serialized into a byte array 
            : using a System.ComponentModel.TypeConverter
            : and then encoded with base64 encoding.

    <value>Water Signs are exceptionally emotional and ultra-sensitive.
They are highly intuitive and they can be as mysterious as the
ocean itself. Water signs love profound conversations and intimacy.
They rarely do anything openly and are always there to support their

    <value>The planetary alignment this week gives you a chance to get your own needs met by asking for things! Sometimes you don't see what you need because you are more concerned for others. However, this placement makes your emotions urgent and vivid - and you somehow find the nerve to ask other people to do for you, instead of vice versa! Show the world you mean business and take your health into your own hands. Watch your diet carefully!</value>

  <data name="lblLuck.Text" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>Neptune rules your 9th house of good fortune and as a result of this shows that you are progressive in your thinking and through this will make your own way in life. You have the gift of thinking outside the square and can be rather inventive in the way you approach your work and relationships. Those who think differently can usually come up with completely different solutions and this is how you will create your own luck. Don’t ever be afraid to be unique.</value>

  <data name="lblTravel.Text" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>If your trip's going a little less than smoothly at the beginning of the week, your thoughts will naturally turn to home. But before you let it progress to homesickness, remember that the grass only looks greener on the ol' other side -- and that you left home behind for a reason. Take extra good care of yourself midweek (maybe now's the time for that massage or hot tub or fruity drink as big as your head) and don't let little mishaps get you down. By the weekend, you realize it's all part of the experience, and before you know it, you're enjoying yourself again.</value>

  <data name="lblMoney.Text" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>You're coming into your own now. There's a kind of gravitas to you, and others can't help but notice the difference. But it's your home that may require you to spend more than you'd anticipated or budgeted for. If you find that you need to temporarily scale back, that's fine. But trying to force your ideas to come to fruition now may just not be possible.</value>

  <data name="lblCareer.Text" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>The next move is yours - no one else's. You have to work for recognition. It is not going to be handed to you on a silver platter. You need to put in the work in order to get where you want to go. You are on the right track. Don't give up now.</value>

  <data name="lblLove.Text" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>Sometimes the moonlight plays tricks upon us, and at other times it creates the kind of atmosphere that is so celebrated in love poems. There is a wonderfully potent atmosphere today that may also trick you into doing or saying something that you could regret at a later date. Go ahead and do all the usual romantic things, but don't get too carried away!</value>
